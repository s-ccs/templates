\title{Advisor Feedback Sheet}

\begin{document}
  % Everything you do should be done inside the questionnaire environment.

  % If you don't like the default text at the beginning of each questionnaire
  % you can remove it with the optional [noinfo] parameter for the environment 
  \begin{questionnaire}[noinfo]
	  \begin{Form}
    % There is a predefined "info" style to hilight some text.
    \begin{info}
	    Please fill out the sheet as honest as possible. As far as I can foresee, there will be no negative or positive consequences for being honest. You should fill this questionnaire only after you received your grade. The aim of this feedback is, to improve our supervision for future generations of students!
